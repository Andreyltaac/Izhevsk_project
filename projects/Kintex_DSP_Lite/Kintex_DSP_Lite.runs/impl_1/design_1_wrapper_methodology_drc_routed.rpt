TIMING-4#1 Critical Warning
Invalid primary clock redefinition on a clock tree  
Invalid clock redefinition on a clock tree. The primary clock design_1_i/clk_wiz_0/inst/clk_in1 is defined downstream of clock sample_rate_30_72_design_1_clk_DSP_0 and overrides its insertion delay and/or waveform definition
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-6#1 Critical Warning
No common primary clock between related clocks  
The clocks clk_out1_design_1_clk_wiz_0_0 and sample_rate_30_72_design_1_clk_DSP_0 are related (timed together) but they have no common primary clock. The design could fail in hardware. To find a timing path between these clocks, run the following command: report_timing -from [get_clocks clk_out1_design_1_clk_wiz_0_0] -to [get_clocks sample_rate_30_72_design_1_clk_DSP_0]
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-6#2 Critical Warning

The clocks sample_rate_30_72_design_1_clk_DSP_0 and clk_out1_design_1_clk_wiz_0_0 are related (timed together) but they have no common primary clock. The design could fail in hardware. To find a timing path between these clocks, run the following command: report_timing -from [get_clocks sample_rate_30_72_design_1_clk_DSP_0] -to [get_clocks clk_out1_design_1_clk_wiz_0_0]
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-6#3 Critical Warning
No common primary clock between related clocks  
The clocks sample_rate_30_72_design_1_clk_DSP_0 and prm_clk_ad2 are related (timed together) but they have no common primary clock. The design could fail in hardware. To find a timing path between these clocks, run the following command: report_timing -from [get_clocks sample_rate_30_72_design_1_clk_DSP_0] -to [get_clocks prm_clk_ad2]
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-7#1 Critical Warning
No common node between related clocks  
The clocks clk_out1_design_1_clk_wiz_0_0 and sample_rate_30_72_design_1_clk_DSP_0 are related (timed together) but they have no common node. The design could fail in hardware. To find a timing path between these clocks, run the following command: report_timing -from [get_clocks clk_out1_design_1_clk_wiz_0_0] -to [get_clocks sample_rate_30_72_design_1_clk_DSP_0]
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-8#1 Critical Warning
No common period between related clocks  
The clocks sample_rate_30_72_design_1_clk_DSP_0 and prm_clk_ad2 are found related (timed together) but have no common (expandable) period
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-27#1 Critical Warning
Invalid primary clock on hierarchical pin  
A primary clock design_1_i/clk_wiz_0/inst/clk_in1 is created on an inappropriate internal pin design_1_i/clk_wiz_0/inst/clk_in1. It is not recommended to create a primary clock on a hierarchical pin when its driver pin has a fanout connected to multiple clock pins

XDCB-5#1 Warning
Runtime inefficient way to find pin objects  
The option '-to : [get_pins -quiet -hier *reset_sync_in_reg*/PRE -filter {NAME =~ *i_reset_manager*}]' of constraint 'set_false_path' uses inefficient query to find pin objects (see constraint position '132' in the Timing Constraint window in Vivado IDE). To reduce runtime, it is recommended to get the pins through the cell objects. Please refer to Using Constraints Guide (Constraints Efficiency). An example of optimal query is: get_pins -filter {REF_PIN_NAME=~yy*} -of_objects [get_cells -hierarchical xx*].

XDCB-5#2 Warning
Runtime inefficient way to find pin objects  
The option '-to : [get_pins -quiet -hier *reset_sync_in_reg*/PRE -filter {NAME =~ *i_reset_manager*}]' of constraint 'set_false_path' uses inefficient query to find pin objects (see constraint position '133' in the Timing Constraint window in Vivado IDE). To reduce runtime, it is recommended to get the pins through the cell objects. Please refer to Using Constraints Guide (Constraints Efficiency). An example of optimal query is: get_pins -filter {REF_PIN_NAME=~yy*} -of_objects [get_cells -hierarchical xx*].
